                In our recent activity on event-driven programming, we embarked on an exciting project to create a personal website. This hands-on experience taught us essential skills in web development, focusing on HTML and CSS. We structured our site to include several key pages: a resume, an about me section, testimonials, and a services page. Each component was designed to showcase our individual strengths and aspirations effectively. Our teacher guided us through the process of customizing our site, emphasizing the importance of aesthetics in web design. I learned how to change colors and add background images, which significantly enhanced the visual appeal of my website. By manipulating CSS properties, I was able to create a cohesive look that reflects my personality and professional style. Additionally, I gained insight into how different elements interact within a webpage. For instance, I learned to use classes and IDs to target specific sections for styling, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the layout. The experience also highlighted the significance of user experience in design; we aimed to create an intuitive navigation system that makes it easy for visitors to explore each page. Implementing testimonials taught me the power of social proof, as real feedback can greatly influence perceptions of credibility and trustworthiness. Overall, this activity not only improved my technical skills in coding but also deepened my understanding of how thoughtful design choices can impact user engagement. I now feel more confident in my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages, setting a solid foundation for future projects in event-driven programming and web development.
